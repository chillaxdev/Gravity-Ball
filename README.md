# Gravity-Ball
Gravity ball is a game which is inspired from [Gravity Guy](http://www.y8.com/games/gravity_guy). This game compiles only on Borland discontinued Turbo C++ compiler. I've seen many schools and colleges (especially India) still using this ancient compiler. When I google searched for turbo c++ projects. I didn't find any good Object oriented programming with this compiler. Most students are often confused with OOP. Hence I made it public with the only intention to do knowledge sharing.

In case you are going to use this for your project. Just keep these things in mind. First of all analyse this project completely. Don't simply submit this project as it is. Instead create your own from scratch. Learn the beauty of object oriented programming. Learn the way I've merged classes. Learn the way I’ve done parallel programming. You have to think, plan, and analyse before you create any classes. You have to think only in terms of objects. I’ve made as many comments as possible. But its upto you, good luck!

This game doesn't use any 3rd party 2d game engines. Long back we didn't have any open source game engines. So I had to create my own small 2d physics engine. Okay now lets get started with project.

## Getting Started

1. Set up your IDE (Integrated development environment) first. You can download the Turbo C++ 4.0 compiler for Windows 7/8/10 32bit program (since it is 16 bit you will need dosbox to run 16bit files) from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_LCZZjtZ3WPUFVxanFNM2tNWk0/view?usp=sharing)
