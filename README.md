# Gravity-Ball
Gravity ball is a game which is inspired from [Gravity Guy](http://www.y8.com/games/gravity_guy). This game compiles only on Borland discontinued Turbo C++ compiler. I've seen many schools and colleges (especially India) still using this ancient compiler. When I google searched for turbo c++ projects. I didn't find any good Object oriented programming with this compiler. Most students are often confused with OOP. Hence I made it public with the only intention to do knowledge sharing.
